### Steps:

- Create a new Overlay in your StreamElements dashboard, and make it host a Custom Widget
- Copy and paste the provided code into the HTML tab of the new widget:
https://github.com/ulule/StreamElementsWidgets/blob/907dcc46029687579d715ed2f3ad5e4d54985cd3/src/alert/index.html#L1-L11
- Save the newly created overlay
- Share your StreamElements Account ID and JWT Token with your coach at Ulule to finish activating the widget

### Advanced configuration:

Feel free to implement custom CSS code within the StreamElements CSS tab to make the widget suit your liking!

### Advanced testing with a custom event:

If you're already familiar with StreamElements Custom Widget development, you can send your own test events should you want to make sure the widget meets your needs.

This is an exemple of the `POST` payload expected by the widget:
```jsonc
{
    "event": "sub",
    "data": {
        "currency": "‚Ç¨",
        "months": 1,
        "tip": "20", // Optional
        "subName": "Tier 1",
        "userName": "Jane Doe",
        "years": 3,
    }
}
```

There are two different and possible payload types, dependending on the `event` value provided: `contribution` or `sub`.

**Details**

`contribution`-type event:
| Field (path) | Type | Required | Description | Example |
|:---|:---|:---:|---|---|
| `event` | `"contribution"` | Yes | Event type. Use `contribution` for reward-based fundraisers. | `"contribution"` |

```
